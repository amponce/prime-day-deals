    <h2>Understanding TV Room Lighting Basics</h2>
    
    <p>
      Before diving into specific setups, it's crucial to understand how lighting affects your viewing experience and why it matters more than you might think.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Lighting Matters</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reduces eye strain:</strong> Proper ambient lighting prevents your eyes from constantly adjusting between bright screen and dark room</li>
      <li><strong>Improves perceived contrast:</strong> The right backlighting can make blacks appear deeper and colors more vibrant</li>
      <li><strong>Creates atmosphere:</strong> Lighting sets the mood for different viewing experiences</li>
      <li><strong>Protects your vision:</strong> Watching TV in complete darkness can cause eye fatigue and headaches</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of TV Room Lighting</h2>

    <h3>1. Bias Lighting (Behind the TV)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Bias lighting is the most important element of TV room lighting. This is the light placed directly behind your TV that creates a gentle glow around the screen.
    </p>

    <div className="tip-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The ideal bias light color temperature is 6500K (daylight), which matches the white point calibration of most TVs. This prevents color perception issues.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Bias Lighting Options</h4>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LED light strips:</strong> Affordable and easy to install, stick directly to TV back</li>
      <li><strong>Dedicated bias lights:</strong> Professional-grade options with precise color temperature</li>
      <li><strong>Smart RGB strips:</strong> Can change colors but should be set to 6500K for viewing</li>
      <li><strong>TV-mounted lights:</strong> Clip-on options that don't require adhesive</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Ambient Lighting (Room Lighting)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Ambient lighting fills the room with soft, indirect light that complements your bias lighting without creating glare on the screen.
    </p>

    <h4>Best Ambient Lighting Practices</h4>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Use dimmable lights to adjust brightness for different content</li>
      <li>Position lights to avoid direct reflection on the TV screen</li>
      <li>Warm white (2700-3000K) creates a cozy atmosphere</li>
      <li>Place lights at different heights for layered lighting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Accent Lighting</h3>
    
    <p>
      Accent lighting adds visual interest and can highlight architectural features or decor in your TV room.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wall washers:</strong> Create dramatic effects on textured walls</li>
      <li><strong>Shelf lighting:</strong> Illuminate collectibles or media storage</li>
      <li><strong>Cove lighting:</strong> Hidden LED strips in ceiling recesses</li>
      <li><strong>Floor uplights:</strong> Add depth to corners</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setting Up Your Bias Lighting</h2>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Installation</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Clean the TV back:</strong> Ensure the surface is dust-free for good adhesion</li>
      <li><strong>Measure and cut:</strong> If using LED strips, measure the TV perimeter minus 2-4 inches from edges</li>
      <li><strong>Plan the route:</strong> Start from the bottom corner nearest the power source</li>
      <li><strong>Apply strips:</strong> Follow the TV edge, leaving space at corners for bending</li>
      <li><strong>Connect power:</strong> Use the TV's USB port if available for automatic on/off</li>
      <li><strong>Test and adjust:</strong> Fine-tune brightness to about 10% of TV's peak brightness</li>
    </ol>

    <div className="warning-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Avoid LED strips that are too bright or have uneven light distribution. Look for strips with at least 30 LEDs per meter for smooth, even lighting.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Smart Lighting Integration</h2>

    <p>
      Modern smart lighting systems can transform your viewing experience by automatically adjusting to what you're watching.
    </p>

    <h3>Popular Smart Lighting Options</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Philips Hue Play:</strong> Syncs with TV content for immersive lighting</li>
      <li><strong>LIFX:</strong> Wi-Fi enabled strips with rich colors</li>
      <li><strong>Govee Immersion:</strong> Camera-based system that matches on-screen colors</li>
      <li><strong>Nanoleaf:</strong> Modular panels for artistic accent lighting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting Up Content-Synced Lighting</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Choose a system compatible with your TV or streaming device</li>
      <li>Install the lighting hardware around or behind your TV</li>
      <li>Connect the sync box or camera to your video source</li>
      <li>Calibrate colors and response time through the app</li>
      <li>Adjust intensity to avoid distraction during viewing</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Lighting for Different Viewing Scenarios</h2>

    <h3>Movie Night</h3>
    
    <p>
      For cinematic experiences, create a theater-like atmosphere:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Dim ambient lights to 20-30% brightness</li>
      <li>Use warm white (2700K) for cozy feeling</li>
      <li>Keep bias lighting at medium intensity</li>
      <li>Turn off any lights in your peripheral vision</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sports and Gaming</h3>
    
    <p>
      Brighter environments work better for fast-paced content:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Increase ambient lighting to 40-50%</li>
      <li>Use cooler white light (4000K) for alertness</li>
      <li>Consider dynamic bias lighting that reacts to action</li>
      <li>Ensure no glare from windows or lamps</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Casual Daytime Viewing</h3>
    
    <p>
      Balance natural and artificial light:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use sheer curtains to diffuse harsh sunlight</li>
      <li>Supplement with ambient lighting as needed</li>
      <li>Adjust TV brightness settings for daytime viewing</li>
      <li>Position seating to avoid window reflections</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Lighting Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

    <h3>1. Overhead Lighting</h3>
    
    <p>
      Ceiling lights directly above or in front of the TV create glare and wash out the picture. If you must use overhead lighting, ensure it's dimmable and positioned behind the viewing area.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Bright White Walls</h3>
    
    <p>
      Pure white walls can create distracting reflections. Consider painting the wall behind your TV a neutral gray or using a darker accent color to improve contrast perception.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Ignoring Natural Light</h3>
    
    <p>
      Windows can be your enemy or ally. Use blackout curtains for serious movie watching, or position your TV perpendicular to windows to minimize glare.
    </p>

    <div className="tip-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Budget Tip:</strong> Start with basic bias lighting ($20-30) before investing in smart systems. Even simple LED strips make a huge difference in viewing comfort and picture quality.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Advanced Lighting Techniques</h2>

    <h3>Zone Lighting</h3>
    
    <p>
      Create different lighting zones for various activities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Viewing zone:</strong> Focused on optimal TV watching</li>
      <li><strong>Reading zone:</strong> Brighter task lighting for other activities</li>
      <li><strong>Ambient zone:</strong> General room lighting for when TV is off</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Automated Lighting Scenes</h3>
    
    <p>
      Use smart home integration to create one-touch lighting scenes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>"Movie Time" - Dims lights and activates bias lighting</li>
      <li>"Game Mode" - Brighter, more energetic lighting</li>
      <li>"TV Off" - Transitions to general room lighting</li>
    </ul>
