    <h2>Understanding Your Cable Management Options</h2>
    
    <p>
      Before diving into specific techniques, it's important to understand what cables you're dealing with and choose the right solution for your situation.
    </p>

    <h3>Common TV Cables to Manage</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power cable:</strong> The thick cable that connects to your outlet</li>
      <li><strong>HDMI cables:</strong> For gaming consoles, streaming devices, and sound systems</li>
      <li><strong>Ethernet cable:</strong> For wired internet connections</li>
      <li><strong>Audio cables:</strong> For soundbars and surround sound systems</li>
      <li><strong>Antenna/Cable TV:</strong> Coaxial cables for traditional TV services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method 1: In-Wall Cable Management (For Homeowners)</h2>

    <p>
      In-wall cable management provides the cleanest, most professional look. This method completely hides cables inside your walls, creating a floating TV appearance.
    </p>

    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>In-wall rated power kit (required by code for power cables)</li>
      <li>Low-voltage mounting brackets</li>
      <li>Fish tape or glow rods</li>
      <li>Drywall saw</li>
      <li>Stud finder</li>
      <li>Level</li>
    </ul>

    <div className="warning-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Safety First:</strong> Never run a standard power cable through your walls - it's against electrical code and a fire hazard. Always use an in-wall rated power kit that includes proper outlets.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Installation</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Plan your route:</strong> Use a stud finder to locate studs and plan a path that avoids them</li>
      <li><strong>Mark locations:</strong> Mark where your TV will mount and where cables will exit near your devices</li>
      <li><strong>Cut openings:</strong> Use a drywall saw to cut openings for your mounting brackets</li>
      <li><strong>Install brackets:</strong> Secure the low-voltage brackets in the openings</li>
      <li><strong>Run cables:</strong> Use fish tape to pull cables through the wall</li>
      <li><strong>Install power kit:</strong> Follow manufacturer instructions for the in-wall power solution</li>
      <li><strong>Patch and paint:</strong> Clean up any rough edges and touch up paint if needed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Method 2: Cable Raceways (Renter-Friendly)</h2>

    <p>
      Cable raceways are the perfect solution for renters or anyone who wants a clean look without cutting into walls. These paintable channels attach to your wall and hide cables beautifully.
    </p>

    <h3>Choosing the Right Raceway</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Size:</strong> Measure your cable bundle to ensure the raceway is large enough</li>
      <li><strong>Material:</strong> PVC raceways are affordable and paintable</li>
      <li><strong>Color:</strong> Choose white for light walls or get paintable versions</li>
      <li><strong>Adhesive:</strong> Look for strong adhesive that won't damage walls when removed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Installation Tips</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Clean the wall surface thoroughly before installation</li>
      <li>Plan your route using painter's tape first</li>
      <li>Cut raceways with a fine-tooth saw for clean edges</li>
      <li>Use corner pieces for professional-looking turns</li>
      <li>Paint after installation for a seamless look</li>
    </ol>

    <div className="tip-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Run raceways along baseboards or crown molding where they'll blend in naturally with your room's architecture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Method 3: Cord Covers and Sleeves</h2>

    <p>
      For a quick and affordable solution, cord covers and sleeves can tidy up cables without any installation. These are perfect for temporary setups or when you need flexibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Cord Covers</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fabric sleeves:</strong> Flexible and easy to install, great for multiple cables</li>
      <li><strong>Spiral wrap:</strong> Allows cables to exit at any point</li>
      <li><strong>Split loom tubing:</strong> Durable protection for heavy-use areas</li>
      <li><strong>Adhesive cord covers:</strong> Flat profiles that stick directly to walls</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method 4: Furniture and Decor Solutions</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes the best cable management uses what you already have. Strategic furniture placement and decorative elements can hide cables effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>Creative Hiding Spots</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TV stands with cable management:</strong> Many modern stands include built-in routing</li>
      <li><strong>Decorative boxes:</strong> Place a stylish box on your console to hide power strips</li>
      <li><strong>Plants:</strong> A tall plant can naturally conceal cables running down a wall</li>
      <li><strong>Cable spine:</strong> Vertical organizers that look like modern art</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advanced Tips for Complex Setups</h2>

    <h3>Managing Multiple Devices</h3>
    
    <p>
      If you have gaming consoles, streaming devices, and sound systems, organization becomes crucial:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use cable labels to identify each cable</li>
      <li>Group cables by device using velcro ties</li>
      <li>Install a cable management box behind your TV stand</li>
      <li>Use right-angle adapters to reduce cable strain</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wireless Alternatives</h3>
    
    <p>
      Reduce cable clutter by going wireless where possible:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wireless HDMI:</strong> Transmit video signals without cables</li>
      <li><strong>Bluetooth audio:</strong> Connect soundbars and speakers wirelessly</li>
      <li><strong>Smart TV features:</strong> Use built-in apps instead of external devices</li>
      <li><strong>Wireless charging shelves:</strong> Keep device batteries topped up</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Planning for Future Upgrades</h2>

    <p>
      When setting up your cable management system, think ahead:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Leave extra space in raceways for future cables</li>
      <li>Install pull strings in conduits for easy cable additions</li>
      <li>Choose modular systems that can expand</li>
      <li>Document your setup with photos for future reference</li>
    </ul>

    <div className="tip-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Money-Saving Tip:</strong> Buy cable management supplies during Prime Day or Black Friday. Basic supplies like raceways, velcro ties, and cable boxes are often deeply discounted.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>

    <h3>Cables Too Short</h3>
    
    <p>
      Plan cable lengths carefully. It's better to have cables slightly too long than too short. Use these solutions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>HDMI extenders for longer runs</li>
      <li>Right-angle adapters to save space</li>
      <li>Relocate devices closer to the TV</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interference and Signal Issues</h3>
    
    <p>
      Poor cable management can cause interference:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Separate power cables from signal cables</li>
      <li>Use shielded cables for longer runs</li>
      <li>Avoid tight bends that can damage cables</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maintenance and Updates</h2>

    <p>
      A good cable management system should be easy to maintain:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use removable labels for easy identification</li>
      <li>Leave service loops for equipment adjustments</li>
      <li>Periodically check and tighten connections</li>
      <li>Dust cable runs to prevent overheating</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      Professional-looking cable management doesn't require professional installation. With the right approach and materials, you can transform your TV setup from a tangled mess to a clean, organized showcase. Whether you choose in-wall installation, raceways, or creative concealment, the key is planning your approach and using quality materials.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember, good cable management isn't just about aesthetics - it also protects your expensive cables, improves safety, and makes future upgrades much easier. Take the time to do it right, and you'll enjoy a cleaner, more organized entertainment space for years to come.
